### Popular Roastery Styles

Roasting transforms green coffee beans into the aromatic brown beans that we consume. Different roasting levels unleash different flavors from the beans. Here's a breakdown of popular roastery styles:

1. **Light Roast**: Often used for milder coffee varieties, light roasting retains most of the original coffee characteristics. It typically results in a lighter-bodied coffee with higher acidity and no roasted flavor taste.

2. **Medium Roast**: This roast is medium brown in color with a stronger flavor and non-oily surface. It's often referred to as the American roast because it's generally preferred in the United States.

3. **Medium-Dark Roast**: With a richer, darker color, this roast has some oil on the surface and a slight bittersweet aftertaste. It's used in specialty coffees to create a fuller body.

4. **Dark Roast**: Dark roasts produce shiny black beans with an oily surface and pronounced bitterness. The dark roast's deep, bold flavors are used in many popular espresso blends.

5. **Cold Brew Roasting**: Tailored for cold brewing, these roasts are often designed to minimize acidity and maximize sweetness to suit the cold brew method.

6. **Single Origin Roasting**: This involves roasting beans from a single geographical region, sometimes even a single farm, to highlight the unique characteristics of that specific location.

7. **Blending**: This style involves mixing beans from different locations before or after roasting to create a balanced flavor profile.

Each of these styles brings out different aspects of the coffee's flavor, allowing coffee enthusiasts to choose based on personal preference. Coffee roasting is an art form that combines science and sensory skills, and the choices in roasting method and bean origin contribute to the vast array of flavors available in the world of coffee.
