Our Company

Opti Coffee is a coffee roasting company based in Seattle, Washington. We are passionate about sourcing, roasting, and serving the finest coffee from around the world.

Our company was founded in 2010 by two coffee enthusiasts, Jake and Mia, who met at a barista competition and decided to pursue their dream of creating their own coffee brand. They started with a small roastery in their garage, where they experimented with different beans, roasts, and blends. Soon, they gained a loyal following of local customers who appreciated their craft and quality.

Since then, Opti Coffee has grown into a successful business with over 50 stores across the country, as well as a network of warehouses, subcompanies, and online platforms. We also have plans to expand internationally, with the aim of bringing our coffee to more people and places. We are always looking for new opportunities and challenges to improve our products and services.

We are proud to work with some of the best coffee farmers, traders, and roasters in the industry, who share our values and vision. We collaborate with them to ensure that our coffee is ethically sourced, sustainably grown, and fairly traded. We also support various social and environmental initiatives that benefit the coffee communities and the planet.

At Opti Coffee, we believe in fostering a culture of excellence, innovation, and diversity. We value our team members, who are the heart and soul of our company. We encourage them to learn, grow, and express their creativity and passion. We also strive to provide our customers with the best possible coffee experience, from the first sip to the last drop. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and ideas from our customers, as we believe that they are part of our coffee family.

We invite you to join us on our coffee journey, and discover the stories, flavors, and aromas that make our coffee unique and special. Thank you for choosing Opti Coffee, and we hope to see you soon.
