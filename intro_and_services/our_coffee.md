At Opti Coffee, we are passionate about sharing our love of coffee with our customers. Whether you visit one of our cozy cafes, our retail stores, or our warehouse outlets, you will find a variety of products to suit your taste and preference.

Our Products

We offer a range of coffee products at our dine-in and retail locations, including:

- Coffee: We roast our own beans in small batches, using carefully selected and ethically sourced arabica and robusta beans from different regions of the world. You can enjoy our coffee by the cup, or buy our whole or ground beans to brew at home.
- Coffee Drinks: We prepare our coffee drinks with skill and care, using our own espresso blend, fresh milk, and natural syrups. You can choose from classics like cappuccino, latte, and americano, or try our seasonal specials like pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread mocha, and iced caramel macchiato.
- Beans: If you want to explore the diverse flavors and aromas of coffee, you can buy our beans by the bag at our retail stores. We offer a variety of single-origin and blended beans, from light to dark roast, and from smooth to bold. You can also find our decaf, organic, and fair-trade options.
- Souvenirs: If you want to show your support for Opti Coffee, or find a gift for a coffee lover, you can browse our souvenirs at our retail stores. We have mugs, tumblers, shirts, hats, bags, and more, all featuring our logo and slogan.

Our Special Products

Some of our stores have special products that are exclusive to their location, such as:

- Origin City Store: This is where Opti Coffee started, and where we still roast our beans. Here, you can find our origin series, which are limited-edition beans from the countries where we source our coffee, such as Ethiopia, Colombia, and Indonesia. You can also take a tour of our roastery and learn more about our roasting process and history.
- Largest Store: This is our flagship store, and the biggest one in our chain. Here, you can find our premium series, which are rare and exquisite beans from some of the most sought-after regions and farms in the world, such as Jamaica, Hawaii, and Yemen. You can also enjoy our coffee bar, where you can sample different brewing methods and techniques, such as pour-over, siphon, and cold brew.
- 10th Anniversary Store: This is our newest store, and the one we built to celebrate our 10th anniversary. Here, you can find our anniversary series, which are special blends and flavors that we created to mark our milestone, such as chocolate cherry, hazelnut cream, and cinnamon spice. You can also join our events and workshops, where you can learn more about coffee culture and art.

Our Warehouse Products

If you are looking for a bargain, you can visit our warehouse outlets, where you can find our clearance products, such as:

- Overstock: These are products that we have too much of, or that are nearing their expiration date. You can find great deals on our beans, drinks, and souvenirs, but be quick, as they sell out fast.
- Seconds: These are products that have minor defects or damages, such as chipped mugs, stained shirts, or mislabeled bags. You can still enjoy their quality and functionality, but at a lower price.
- Samples: These are products that we have tested or tried, but have not launched or discontinued. You can find unique and experimental products, such as new blends, flavors, or formats, but be aware that they may not be available again.

Our Signature Coffee

Our signature coffee at Opti Coffee is the Brew master's Blend, and it is special for several reasons:

- It is a blend of four different beans from four different continents, creating a balanced and complex flavor profile that appeals to a wide range of palates.
- It is a medium roast, which preserves the natural sweetness and acidity of the beans, while enhancing their body and aroma.
- It is versatile, as it can be brewed using any method, and enjoyed black or with milk and sugar.
- It is our founder's favorite coffee, and the one he drinks every morning. He personally oversees the roasting and blending of this coffee, and ensures its consistency and quality.

We invite you to try our signature coffee, and discover why it is the best-selling and most-loved coffee at Opti Coffee.
