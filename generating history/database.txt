I am the owner of "Opti Coffee Roasting Company", where we have hundreds of roasting facilities over the world.

Now, I want to do some simulation evaluation, and you need to write some code for me to generate some simulated data.


Write Python code to generate some "supplier" CSV file with cofee bean farmer information, which contains many columns, including but not limited to:
supplier name, country, city, phone number, address, max purchase this year, unit price, min purchase this year, ...

Great! Now, create a Python code to generate "demand.csv" which contains all cafe shops (my customers). Add more columns and more information to the CSV file.
